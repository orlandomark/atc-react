  Darktrace can completely isolate a host or apply more surgical blocks, known as pattern of life, to communication streams depending on the threat identified. This action can be applied to a workstation, server, mobile device, or appliance. These blocks are most often modified, approved, or expanded based on automated actions Darktrace recommends or has already taken. 
  See ''SOPIR003, Isolating and Deisolating a Host with Darktrace Antigena'''

  Alternatively, manual network isolation can be achieved by applying network containment in Crowdstrike.
