  Work with legal to request fraudulent domain takedown

  Scenarios where we would follow this playbook include:
    - A fake KKR social media profile is discovered
    - A fake KKR web site is discovered
    - A deliberately misspelled domain aiming to emulate the KKR brand or services
    - Damaging content is uncovered in online video platforms such as YouTube
    - Online message board posts displaying offensive or damaging content relating to the KKR brand

In such incidents, we engage our third-party vendor ZeroFox to perform a takedown of the domain or offending social media page/s.  We must also contact our KKR legal and public-policy teams to notify them of the incident should any further legislative or public-relations actions be required. See ''Fraudulent Domain Typosquatting Social Media KKR Branding.''
