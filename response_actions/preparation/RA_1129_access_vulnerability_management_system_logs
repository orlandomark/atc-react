    Access vulnerability management system logs to obtain information about previously
    detected vulnerabilities and security gaps that may be exploited during an incident.
    
    1. Identify vulnerability management systems in use
    2. Access log repositories for these systems
    3. Verify log retention period covers the timeframe of interest
    4. Extract relevant logs for assets under investigation
    5. Search for specific vulnerabilities that might be relevant to the incident
    6. Correlate findings with other event data
    
    Key artifacts to collect:
    - Vulnerability scan reports for affected systems
    - Patch management and remediation records
    - Asset vulnerability history
    - Configuration assessment results
